```python
# Example of good type safety (from models/user.py)
class User(BaseModel):
    user_id: str = Field(..., description="ユーザーのプライマリキー（Discord ID）")
    rate: int = Field(default=1500, description="現在のレート")

    @field_serializer('rate', 'max_rate')
    def serialize_int_fields(self, value):
        return Decimal(int(value)) if value is not None else None
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/React) Quality: 7.5/10

**Strengths:**

- Good use of generic types

```typescript
// Example of good typing
export interface MatchData {
  match_id: number;
  team1_players: PlayerInfo[];
  team2_players: PlayerInfo[];
  status: MatchStatus;
}
```

### Accessibility Considerations: 5.0/10

**Missing Accessibility Features:**
- No ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Missing focus management
- No screen reader considerations
- Insufficient color contrast considerations

def handler(event, context):
    try:
        # Business logic
        result = service.process_request(event)
        return create_success_response(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return create_error_response(str(e))
```

### DynamoDB Usage Patterns: 7.0/10

**Good Practices:**

---

## 7. Specific Findings with Examples

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. Environment Name Inconsistency
**Issue:** Backend Makefile uses `prd` instead of the required `prod`
```bash
# backend/Makefile line 26 - CRITICAL ERROR
sls deploy -s prd  # Should be 'prod'
```

#### 2. Excessive Debug Output
**Issue:** 453 print statements in backend, 160 console logs in frontend
```python
# Replace debug prints with proper logging
print(f"Matchmaking result: {result}")  # ❌ Bad
logger.info("Matchmaking completed", extra={"result": result})  # ✅ Good
```

#### 3. Missing Error Boundaries
**Issue:** No React error boundaries for graceful error handling
```typescript
// Need to implement error boundary component
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // Error boundary implementation
}
```

### Performance Concerns

#### 1. Large Component Re-renders
**File:** `frontend/src/components/UnitemateApp.tsx`
- 300+ lines in single component
- Multiple useEffect hooks
- No memoization

#### 2. Missing Request Caching
**File:** `frontend/src/hooks/useUnitemateApi.ts`
- No caching strategy for API calls
- Potential for redundant requests

### Security Considerations

#### 1. Environment Variable Exposure
**Risk Level:** Medium
- Multiple .env files in frontend directory
- Potential for sensitive data exposure

#### 2. Authentication Implementation
**Status:** Good
- Proper Auth0 integration
- JWT token handling appears secure
